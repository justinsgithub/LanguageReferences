# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

## NODES 

- a node contains data and links to other nodes
- node data can be of any type including nothing / null
- the link / links in a node are sometimes called pointers
- a node "points" to another node
- data structures typically implement nodes with one or more links
- oftentimes a node can only be linked to from a single other node
- accidentally removing the single link to a node can result in a "lost" node
- when a node is "lost" it is called an orphaned node
- a node with null pointers means you are at the end of the node path
